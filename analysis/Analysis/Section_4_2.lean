# Analysis I, Section 4.2

This file is a translation of Section 4.2 of Analysis I to Lean 4.
All numbering refers to the original text.

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Definition of the "Section 4.2" rationals, `Section_4_2.Int`, as formal differences `a // b` of
  integers `a b:ℤ`, up to equivalence.  (This is a quotient of a scaffolding type
  `Section_4_2.PreRat`, which consists of formal differences without any equivalence imposed.)

- field operations and order on these rationals, as well as an embedding of ℕ and ℤ

- Equivalence with the Mathlib rationals `_root_.Rat` (or `ℚ`), which we will use going forward.

  Decidability of equality. Hint: modify the proof of `DecidableEq Int` from the previous
  section. However, because formal division handles the case of zero denominator separately, it
  may be more convenient to avoid that operation and work directly with the `Quotient` API.
