# Analysis I, Section 5.1: Cauchy sequences

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Notion of a sequence of rationals
- Notions of `ε`-steadiness, eventual `ε`-steadiness, and Cauchy sequences

## Tips from past users

Users of the companion who have completed the exercises in this section are welcome to send their tips for future users in this section as PRs.

  Definition 5.1.1 (Sequence). To avoid some technicalities involving dependent types, we extend
  sequences by zero to the left of the starting point `n₀`.

  coe := fun a ↦ a.seq

/--
Functions from ℕ to ℚ can be thought of as sequences starting from 0; `ofNatFun` performs this conversion.

The `coe` attribute allows the delaborator to print `Sequence.ofNatFun f` as `↑f`, which is more concise; you may safely remove this if you prefer the more explicit notation.
