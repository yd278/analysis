# Analysis I, Appendix A.1: Mathematical Statements

An introduction to mathematical statements.  Showcases some basic tactics and Lean syntax.

-/


-- Example A.1.1. What the textbook calls "statements" are objects of type `Prop` in Lean.  Also, in Lean we tend to assign "junk" values to expressions that might normally be considered undefined, so discussions regarding undefined terms in the textbook should be adjusted accordingly.

#check 2+2=4
#check 2+2=5

/-- Every well-formed statement is either true or false... -/
example (P:Prop) : (P=true) ∨ (P=false) := by simp; tauto

/-- .. but not both. -/
example (P:Prop) : ¬ ((P=true) ∧ (P=false)) := by simp

-- Note: `P=true` and `P=false` simplify to `P` and `¬P` respectively.

/-- To prove that a statement is true, it suffices to show that it is not false, -/
example {P:Prop} (h: P ≠ false) : P = true := by simp; tauto

/-- while to show that a statement is false, it suffices to show that it is not true. -/
example {P:Prop} (h: P ≠ true) : P = false := by simp; tauto

/-- This statement is true, but unlikely to be very useful. -/
example : 2 = 2 := rfl

/-- This statement is also true, but not very efficient. -/
example : 4 ≤ 4 := by norm_num

/- This is an expression, not a statement. -/
#check 2 + 3*5

/- This is a statement, not an expression. -/
#check 2 + 3*5 = 17

#check Prime (30+5)

#check 30+5 ≤ 42-7
