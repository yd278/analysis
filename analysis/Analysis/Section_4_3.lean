# Analysis I, Section 4.3: Absolute value and exponentiation

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter.  In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Basic properties of absolute value and exponentiation on the rational numbers (here we use the
  Mathlib rational numbers `ℚ` rather than the Section 4.2 rational numbers).

Note: to avoid notational conflict, we are using the standard Mathlib definitions of absolute
value and exponentiation.  As such, it is possible to solve several of the exercises here rather
easily using the Mathlib API for these operations.  However, the spirit of the exercises is to
solve these instead using the API provided in this section, as well as more basic Mathlib API for
the rational numbers that does not reference either absolute value or exponentiation.

  Definition 4.3.4 (eps-closeness).  In the text the notion is undefined for ε zero or negative,
  but it is more convenient in Lean to assign a "junk" definition in this case.  But this also
  allows some relaxations of hypotheses in the lemmas that follow.
