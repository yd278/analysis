# Analysis I, Section 5.2: Equivalent Cauchy sequences

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Notion of an ε-close and eventually ε-close sequences of rationals.
- Notion of an equivalent Cauchy sequence of rationals.
