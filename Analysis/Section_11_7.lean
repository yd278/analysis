# Analysis I, Section 11.7: A non-Riemann integrable function

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:
- An example of a bounded function on a compact interval that is not Riemann integrable.
